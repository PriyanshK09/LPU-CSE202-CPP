// Explanation of the above code
// In the above program, we have defined two conversion functions, one for int and another for float.
// When we write x = s1, the compiler will call the conversion function for int and when we write y = s1,
// the compiler will call the conversion function for float.
// Thus, the above program will print the rollno and fees of the student s1.
// The conversion functions are also called type-cast operator because they convert one type of data to another type.
// The conversion functions must be member functions of the class.
// They cannot be friend functions because friend functions are not called with an object.
